Every exercise should have at least one of these:

htdp/atomic
  Every htdp/atomic exercise may also have one of these tags too:
      number
      string
      boolean
      conditional
      image


htdp/structure-simple
htdp/structure-nested
htdp/structure-mixed    (this is for itemizations that are comprised of structures)
htdp/itemization        (this is for other (non-structure) types of itemizations)
htdp/intervals          (for data that is a bunch of possible intervals)
htdp/list-simple        (for simple lists of atomic data)
htdp/list-structure     (involving lists of structures)
htdp/list               (involving more complex lists of things - e.g. lists of lists, etc.)
htdp/self-referential   (other types of self-referential data, e.g. natural numbers)
htdp/tree
htdp/graph
htdp/generative-recursion
htdp/accumulator

htdp/abstraction
htdp/higher-order-func

mutually-referential
multiple-simultaneous-complex   (for functions that work on two or more complex types of inputs, e.g. two lists or a list and a tree)
vector

These are if an exercise uses some particular teachpacks (i.e. libraries)
htdp/batch-io
htdp/world      (for regular animations/interactive programs)
htdp/universe   (this is for fully networked client/server programs)

These tags are related to the domain (i.e. subject matter or topic) of an exercise:

math
education
physics
biology
science
money
data
