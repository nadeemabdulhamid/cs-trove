 Edit your Centipede project once again. Be sure to fix any and all problems that your graders have (or would have) discovered.

Next, you are to use `local` and "loops" (abstractions such as `map`, `foldr`, `filter`, etc.) wherever your functions may benefit from them, especially for the lists of objects in your project. You may also use `lambda` terms in place of locally-named helper functions, if you wish. Update signatures to use `[List-of X]` in place of BSL style data definitions.

You should notice that the length of your program decreases considerably.

Use ISL+ for this program.
