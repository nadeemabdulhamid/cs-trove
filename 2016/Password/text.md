Develop the function `passwords-6-11?`, which consumes a *list of passwords (represented as strings)* and produces a *boolean* indicating whether all are at least 6 characters but less than 11 characters long.

Generalize the function to `passwords-ok?`, which consumes a *list of passwords* and *a minimum and maximum length* and produces a *boolean* indicating whether all passwords are within the allowed length span.
