Twitter is a social networking service that allows users to write messages called tweets that are up to 140 characters.

1. Design a data definition for a `network of Twitter users`. A `Twitter user` should have a **handle** (or name) and **tweeps** (or followers).
Create an example of a network of five or more users.

2. Design a function, `list-handles`, that consumes a network and produces a list of all of the handles in the network. You must use an accumulator.

3. Design a function, `most-followers`, that consumes a network and produces the handle in the network that has the most followers. You must use an accumulator.

4. Design a function, `friends?`, that consumes a network and determines whether it contains two users who follow each other.
