A leafy binary tree is a binary tree with the symbol `'leaf` at its leafs (as opposed to, say, a number).

Design a function that consumes a natural number n and creates *(a list of) all the leafy binary trees that have height n*.

- Hint: Design a function that consumes a natural number n, and creates (a list of) all leafy binary trees of height equal or less than n.

- Hint: If you have to use filter to remove things from the list, you’re working too hard.

- Hint: It might be helpful to draw pictures.

**Note: this is not about abstraction; it’s a kind of puzzle that will exercise your ability to think recursively.**
