Many card games are structured around the taking of tricks, a set of four cards where one card is contributed from each player. Examples of trick-taking games include hearts, bridge and whist.

* Define a function that takes a trick and returns the winning player according to the following rules:

  * High card wins
  
  * In the case of a tie i.e. two or more cards of the same value are played the trick goes to the player with the better suit. (Clubs < Diamonds < Hearts < Spades)

  Note that the problem is purposely left ambiguous in terms of data definitions and requirements. It is up to you to decide how to implement this problem. There is not one right answer, but some answers are better and simpler than others. Make sure to follow the design recipe.
    
* A game is a series of tricks. Design a function that takes a game and returns a winner. The winner is the person who won the most tricks overall.
